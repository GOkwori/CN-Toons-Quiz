Testing occurred continuously throughout the entire development process. I employed Chrome Developer Tools extensively during the build to identify and resolve issues promptly.

Throughout the development phase, I incorporated Google Developer Tools to verify the proper functioning of elements and to aid in diagnosing problems when they arose.

The console within the developer tools was instrumental in dissecting and validating multiple sections of JavaScript code. It served not only to confirm the functionality of the code but also to troubleshoot any encountered issues.

To guarantee responsiveness across diverse screen sizes and devices, I meticulously reviewed each page using both Google Chrome Developer Tools and the Microsoft Edge Inspector tool.
